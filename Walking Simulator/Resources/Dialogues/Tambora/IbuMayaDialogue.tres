The name 'Tambora' comes from 'Ta-Mbora' - meaning 'let us disappear.' The mountain invited people to vanish, and in 1815, it did just that. We must always show respect to these powerful spirits. When Heinrich Zollinger successfully climbed the mountain in 1847, people celebrated, believing the curse was finally lifted and the evil spirits had been expelled.",

Many people come to me before climbing Tambora to receive blessings and protection.",

If you come with respect and pure heart, they will protect you. If you come with arrogance or disrespect, they may test you with storms and dangerous weather.",
