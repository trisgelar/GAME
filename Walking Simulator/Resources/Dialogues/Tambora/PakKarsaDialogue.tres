The caldera formed during the 1815 eruption is now our destination. The climb takes two days - we camp overnight to acclimatize and enjoy the sunrise from this magnificent volcano. The mountain is now a national park, and climbing to the crater requires proper preparation and respect for the mountain's power.",

Each climber must carry emergency supplies, proper clothing for temperature changes, and communication devices. The mountain can be unpredictable, so we always have evacuation plans ready. Respect the mountain, and it will respect you. The mountain spirits are powerful, and we must show proper respect. Many people come to traditional healers like Ibu Maya for blessings before climbing.",

The caldera was formed when the mountain collapsed after ejecting massive amounts of material. Today, it's a place of both beauty and solemn respect. The crater reminds us of the mountain's power and the importance of living in harmony with nature.",
