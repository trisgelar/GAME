The mountain is inhabited by evil spirits. Storms, bad weather, and death await those who are not careful and are tempted by the ghosts of hell.' But my scientific curiosity drove me forward. I was filled with enthusiasm when I became the first person after the eruption to set foot on the summit of this mountain famous for its terrible story.",

After the 1815 eruption, they thought the spirits had been angered. No one knew that Tambora was a volcano, because since ancient times, it had never spewed dust or lava. There was no sound that revealed there was a furnace of fire inside.",

The caldera was immense - evidence of the tremendous power that had been unleashed. I documented the volcanic features, collected botanical samples, and studied the geological formations. When I successfully descended, the locals celebrated, believing the curse was finally lifted and the evil spirits had been expelled.",
