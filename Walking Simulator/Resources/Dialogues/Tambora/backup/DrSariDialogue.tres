Some volcanoes are even monitored by three different posts, each equipped with seismographs, telescopes, wind direction measurements, and thermocouples to monitor fumaroles and solfataras.",

"message": "The 1815 Tambora eruption was a VEI 7 event - the most powerful volcanic eruption in recorded history. It released 400 times more energy than the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated. The mountain was 4,300 meters high before the eruption - now it's only about 2,800 meters. The eruption ejected 140 billion tons of ash and dust halfway to space, creating a 'Year Without Summer' in 1816. This was a super-colossal eruption that defined the millennium.",

However, with our advanced monitoring systems, we can provide early warnings that could save thousands of lives. We watch for slow changes in magma reservoirs, like ground swelling and temperature increases, to detect potential eruptions before they happen.",
