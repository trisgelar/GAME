# Camera System - SOLID Architecture

**Date:** 2025-09-18  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Architecture:** SOLID Principles Applied  

## 🏗️ **SOLID Architecture Overview**

### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Each class has one clear responsibility:
- `CameraViewBase` - Defines camera view interface and common behavior
- `PlayerCameraView` - Handles only player-following camera logic
- `FarSideCameraView` - Handles only far side overview camera logic
- `CanopyCameraView` - Handles only canopy level camera logic
- `CameraViewFactory` - Handles only camera view creation
- `CameraManager` - Handles only camera view coordination (Facade)

### **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Open for extension**: Easy to add new camera views
- **Closed for modification**: Existing views don't need changes

```gdscript
# Adding new view is simple:
# 1. Create new class extending CameraViewBase
# 2. Add to factory enum and create method
# 3. No changes to existing code needed
```

### **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All camera views extend `CameraViewBase`
- Any view can be substituted for another
- Consistent interface across all view types

### **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- `CameraViewBase` provides minimal, focused interface
- Views only implement what they need
- Manager only exposes necessary methods

### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- `CameraManager` depends on `CameraViewBase` abstraction
- Uses `CameraViewFactory` to create concrete instances
- No direct dependencies on concrete view classes

## 🎮 **Current Implementation (Simple)**

### **Available Views:**
1. **Player View (Key 1)** - Default third-person camera
2. **Far Side View (Key 2)** - High overview for hexagon visualization
3. **Canopy View (Key 3)** - Above forest level, following player

### **Usage:**
```gdscript
# In your scene script
@onready var camera_manager: CameraManager = $CameraManager

func _ready():
    # Camera manager automatically initializes with Player View
    camera_manager.camera_view_changed.connect(_on_camera_view_changed)

func _on_camera_view_changed(view_name: String):
    GameLogger.info("📷 Camera switched to: %s" % view_name)
```

## 🚀 **Future Extensibility**

### **Adding New Views (Easy Extension):**

#### **Step 1: Create New View Class**
```gdscript
# Systems/Camera/TopDownCameraView.gd
class_name TopDownCameraView
extends CameraViewBase

func _init():
    view_name = "TopDownView"
    view_description = "Strategic Top-Down View"

func calculate_target_position() -> Vector3:
    var scene_center = get_scene_center()
    return scene_center + Vector3.UP * 60.0

func calculate_target_rotation() -> Vector3:
    return Vector3(deg_to_rad(-90), 0, 0)  # Look straight down
```

#### **Step 2: Update Factory**
```gdscript
# CameraViewFactory.gd
enum ViewType {
    PLAYER_VIEW,
    FAR_SIDE_VIEW,
    CANOPY_VIEW,
    TOP_DOWN_VIEW  # Add new type
}

static func create_view(view_type: ViewType) -> CameraViewBase:
    match view_type:
        # ... existing cases
        ViewType.TOP_DOWN_VIEW:
            return TopDownCameraView.new()  # Add new case
```

#### **Step 3: Update Manager Input**
```gdscript
# CameraManager.gd
func _input(event):
    if event is InputEventKey and event.pressed:
        match event.keycode:
            # ... existing keys
            KEY_4:
                switch_to_view(CameraViewFactory.ViewType.TOP_DOWN_VIEW)
```

### **No Changes Needed To:**
- Existing view classes
- Base class interface
- Manager core logic
- Scene integration

## 🎯 **Benefits for Papua Scene**

### **Development Benefits:**
- **Easy debugging** of hexagonal path system
- **Clear visualization** of terrain and forest interaction
- **Flexible perspective** for asset placement verification
- **Professional presentation** of your work

### **Gameplay Benefits:**
- **Strategic overview** for understanding terrain layout
- **Immersive canopy experience** in forest environment
- **Smooth transitions** between different exploration modes
- **Enhanced appreciation** of the terrain design

### **Technical Benefits:**
- **SOLID architecture** makes adding new views trivial
- **Modular design** allows independent view development
- **Clean separation** of concerns and responsibilities
- **Easy testing** of individual view components

## 🔧 **Integration Steps**

1. **Add to Papua Scene**: Add `CameraManager` node to `PapuaScene_Terrain3D.tscn`
2. **Test Basic Functionality**: Verify view switching works
3. **Fine-tune Positions**: Adjust view positions for optimal hexagon visibility
4. **Enhance Hexagonal Paths**: Use new views to improve path system

**This SOLID architecture ensures your simple camera system can grow naturally as your game develops, without requiring major refactoring.**
