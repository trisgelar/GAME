var cultural_knowledge : Dictionary = {}
var collected_artifacts : Array = []
var visited_villages : Array = []
```

### Phase 2: Content Creation Structure
```

├── Villages/
│   ├── Batak_Village.tscn
│   ├── Javanese_Village.tscn
│   ├── Balinese_Village.tscn
│   └── Toraja_Village.tscn
├── Cultural_Objects/

        "thank_you": "Matur nuwun",
        "goodbye": "Sugeng dalu"
    }
    # Add more languages
}
```

### Cultural Knowledge System
```gdscript
# Cultural artifact interaction
extends InteractableObject

@export var ethnic_group : String
@export var cultural_significance : String
@export var historical_period : String

func _interact():
    CulturalNotebook.add_knowledge(ethnic_group, cultural_significance)
    show_cultural_info()
