# Dialogue System Setup - 2025-08-26

## Problem
The Tambora and Papua scenes had NPCs set up for interaction but were missing the NPCDialogueUI component, preventing dialogue from being displayed when pressing E on NPCs.

## Solution
Added NPCDialogueUI to both Tambora and Papua scenes, completing the dialogue system integration across all three regions.
