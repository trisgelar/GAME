## 🎯 Overview

The Bamboo Optimizer is a powerful tool designed to extract and optimize large bamboo GLB files into usable, performance-friendly bamboo biomes for game development. It's specifically designed for Godot 4.3 and follows the PSX-style asset pipeline.

### 🎮 What Problems Does It Solve?

- **Large File Sizes**: Converts 100MB+ bamboo files into manageable 5-20MB biomes
- **Individual vs. Biomes**: Creates complete bamboo clusters instead of separate stalks/leaves
- **Performance Optimization**: Generates assets suitable for real-time rendering
- **Terrain Integration**: Produces assets ready for placement in Papua and Tambora terrains

---

## 🌿 What is the Bamboo Optimizer?

The Bamboo Optimizer is a Godot tool that:

1. **Analyzes** large bamboo GLB files to understand their structure
2. **Groups** related mesh instances into natural bamboo clusters
3. **Extracts** complete bamboo biomes (not individual pieces)
4. **Optimizes** file sizes while maintaining visual quality
5. **Categorizes** outputs by size for easy terrain placement

### 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Bamboo Biome**: A complete bamboo cluster with multiple stalks, leaves, and bark
- **Mesh Instance**: Individual 3D mesh objects within the scene
- **GLTF/GLB**: Modern 3D file formats that Godot can read/write
- **Scene Hierarchy**: The tree-like structure of 3D objects

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ "Scene has no mesh instances - cannot export"
**Cause**: The scene structure is corrupted or empty  
**Solution**: 
1. Check if source GLB files are valid
2. Ensure the tool has proper file access
3. Try the alternative export method

#### ❌ "Invalid access to property or key 'current_scene' on a base object of type 'null instance'"
**Cause**: The tool is trying to access scene properties that don't exist  
**Solution**: 
1. **Fixed in latest version** - The tool now has robust null checking
2. Ensure you're using the updated `Tools/bamboo_optimizer.gd`
3. The tool will automatically fall back to individual grouping if scene detection fails

#### ❌ "Parameter 'data.tree' is null"
**Cause**: The tool is trying to access tree properties that don't exist  
**Solution**: 
1. **Fixed in latest version** - Added comprehensive null checking for tree access
2. The tool now safely handles cases where mesh instances don't have valid trees
3. Automatic fallback to individual grouping when scene detection fails

#### 🔄 Models are upside down ("terbalik")
**Cause**: Coordinate system mismatch or incorrect transformation during export  
**Solution**: 
1. **Fixed in latest version** - Automatic orientation detection and correction
2. The tool now applies rotation fixes to prevent upside-down models
3. Use the "🔄 Fix Orientation" button to fix existing exported models
4. Models are automatically oriented correctly during new exports

#### ❌ "Cannot access texture directory"
**Cause**: Texture directory doesn't exist  
**Solution**: 
1. This is normal if no textures exist yet
2. The tool will skip texture optimization gracefully
3. Focus on model extraction first

#### ❌ GLB files are 1KB and corrupted
**Cause**: GLTF export failed  
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure you're using Godot 4.3
2. Check the logs for specific error messages
3. The tool now has multiple export methods as fallbacks

#### ❌ "Invalid call. Nonexistent function 'rotate_y' in base 'PackedScene'"
**Cause**: The tool was trying to rotate a PackedScene resource instead of an instantiated Node3D  
**Solution**: 
1. **Fixed in latest version** - The tool now properly instantiates scenes before rotating them
2. Ensure you're using the updated `Tools/bamboo_optimizer.gd`
3. The rotation functions now correctly handle PackedScene resources

#### ⚠️ Very large output files (>50MB)
**Cause**: Individual biomes are still too large  
**Solution**: 
1. Use the size categorization to select appropriate biomes
2. Consider further manual optimization if needed
3. Focus on medium-sized biomes (5-20MB)

### Debug Information

The tool provides extensive logging:
- **Scene structure analysis**
- **Mesh instance counts**
- **File size verification**
- **Export method results**

Check the Godot console and log files for detailed information.

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Biome Grouping Algorithm

The tool uses intelligent grouping to create natural bamboo clusters:

1. **Hierarchy Analysis**: Examines the scene tree structure
2. **Name Pattern Recognition**: Identifies bamboo-related naming patterns
3. **Spatial Grouping**: Groups related mesh instances together
4. **Fallback Grouping**: Uses immediate parent nodes if needed

### Multiple Export Methods

1. **Direct Export**: Exports directly from scene objects
2. **Alternative Export**: Simplified scene structure export
3. **Fallback Export**: Saves as .tscn if GLB export fails

### Texture Optimization

- **Automatic Detection**: Finds bamboo texture files
- **Directory Creation**: Creates organized texture folders
- **Copy Operations**: Copies textures to optimized locations
- **Format Support**: PNG, JPG, DDS formats

## 📚 Examples & Use Cases

### Example 1: Papua Terrain Integration

**Goal**: Add bamboo biomes to Papua forest terrain

**Steps**:
1. Extract bamboo models using the tool
2. Select medium-sized biomes (5-20MB)
3. Copy selected GLB files to Papua terrain assets
4. Place biomes in your terrain scene

**Result**: Natural-looking bamboo groves in Papua terrain

### Example 2: Tambora Terrain Enhancement

**Goal**: Enhance Tambora terrain with bamboo elements

**Steps**:
1. Use the same extracted bamboo biomes
2. Place small biomes for scattered vegetation
3. Use medium biomes for focal points
4. Avoid very large biomes for performance

**Result**: Enhanced Tambora terrain with optimized bamboo assets

### Example 3: Performance Optimization

**Goal**: Reduce memory usage while maintaining visual quality

**Steps**:
1. Extract and categorize all bamboo biomes
2. Use small biomes for distant objects
3. Use medium biomes for visible areas
4. Avoid large biomes unless necessary

**Result**: Optimized performance with minimal visual impact

## 🔬 Technical Details

### GLTF Export Process

```gdscript
# 1. Create GLTF document and state
var gltf_document = GLTFDocument.new()
var gltf_state = GLTFState.new()

# 2. Convert scene to GLTF format
var append_result = gltf_document.append_from_scene(scene, gltf_state)

# 3. Write to filesystem
var write_result = gltf_document.write_to_filesystem(gltf_state, output_path)
```

### Scene Structure Analysis

```gdscript
func analyze_scene_structure(node: Node, mesh_instances: Array):
    if node is MeshInstance3D:
        mesh_instances.append(node)
    
    for child in node.get_children():
        analyze_scene_structure(child, mesh_instances)
```

### Biome Grouping Logic

```gdscript
# Look for natural grouping levels
if (parent_name.contains("bamboo") or 
    parent_name.contains("cluster") or 
    parent_name.contains("FBX") or
    parent_name.contains("Bambusa")):
    biome_key = parent_name
    break
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why are my GLB files still large?
**A**: The tool creates complete bamboo biomes, not individual pieces. Large files may contain multiple bamboo clusters. Use the size categorization to select appropriate biomes.

### Q: Can I use this for other types of vegetation?
**A**: Yes! The tool can be modified for other vegetation types by updating the grouping logic and file paths.

### Q: What if the export fails?
**A**: The tool has multiple fallback methods. Check the logs for specific error messages and try the alternative export methods.

### Q: How do I know which biomes to use?
**A**: Use the "Create Report" function to get size categories and recommendations. Medium-sized biomes (5-20MB) are perfect for terrain.

### Q: Can I optimize the biomes further?
**A**: Yes, you can manually optimize individual biomes using Godot's built-in tools or external 3D software.

### Q: Why does texture optimization sometimes skip?
**A**: This is normal if no bamboo textures exist yet. The tool gracefully handles missing resources.
