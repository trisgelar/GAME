# Shared Assets Integration Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-31  
**Purpose**: Update all PSX asset tests and asset packs to use the organized Shared folder structure

## Overview

We've successfully updated all PSX asset tests and asset packs to use the organized `Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models` folder structure instead of the original `Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models` folder. This ensures consistency between tests and production code, and enables shared assets between Tambora and Papua regions.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated PSX Asset Tests**

#### `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_psx_assets.gd`
- **Before**: Used `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/`
- **After**: Uses `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/`
- **Impact**: Main PSX asset test now uses organized structure

#### `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_tree_isolated.gd`
- **Before**: Used `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/`
- **After**: Uses `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/trees/pine/`
- **Impact**: Tree isolated test uses organized structure

#### `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_format_comparison.gd`
- **Before**: Used various format folders from original PSX folder
- **After**: Uses Shared folder structure for all format comparisons
- **Impact**: Format comparison test now shows organized structure

### 2. **Updated Asset Packs**

#### `Assets/Terrain/Papua/psx_assets.tres`
- **Before**: Referenced `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/`
- **After**: References `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/`
- **Impact**: Papua region uses organized, shared assets

#### `Assets/Terrain/Tambora/psx_assets.tres`
- **Before**: Referenced `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/`
- **After**: References `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/`
- **Impact**: Tambora region uses organized, shared assets

### 3. **Asset Path Mapping**

| **Category** | **Old Path** | **New Path** |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Trees** | `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/pine_tree_n_*.glb` | `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/trees/pine/pine_tree_n_*.glb` |
| **Vegetation (Grass)** | `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/grass_*.glb` | `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/vegetation/grass/grass_*.glb` |
| **Vegetation (Ferns)** | `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/fern_*.glb` | `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/vegetation/ferns/fern_*.glb` |
| **Stones** | `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/stone_*.glb` | `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/stones/rocks/stone_*.glb` |
| **Mushrooms** | `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/mushroom_n_*.glb` | `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/mushrooms/variants/mushroom_n_*.glb` |
| **Debris** | `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/DAE/tree_*.dae` | `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/debris/logs/tree_log_1.dae`<br>`res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/debris/stumps/tree_stump_1.dae` |

## Benefits

### 1. **Consistency**
- All tests and production code use the same asset structure
- No more confusion about which folder to use
- Unified asset management

### 2. **Shared Assets**
- Tambora and Papua regions can share the same assets
- Reduced duplication and storage requirements
- Easier asset management

### 3. **Organized Structure**
- Clear categorization (trees/pine, vegetation/grass, etc.)
- Easy to find and manage specific asset types
- Scalable for future asset additions

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Single source of truth for assets
- Easier to update and maintain
- Better version control

## Tests Updated

1. ✅ `test_psx_assets.gd` - Main PSX asset test
2. ✅ `test_tree_isolated.gd` - Tree isolated test
3. ✅ `test_format_comparison.gd` - Format comparison test
4. ✅ `test_phase2_asset_organization.gd` - Already used Shared structure
5. ✅ `test_psx_placement_editor.gd` - Uses asset packs (automatically updated)

## Asset Packs Updated

1. ✅ `Assets/Terrain/Papua/psx_assets.tres` - Papua region assets
2. ✅ `Assets/Terrain/Tambora/psx_assets.tres` - Tambora region assets

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Shared assets update script** to copy GLB models to Shared folder
2. **Test all updated scenes** to ensure they work correctly
3. **Run asset pack tests** to verify everything loads properly
4. **Update any remaining references** that might still point to old paths

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All PSX asset tests use Shared folder structure
- [ ] Asset packs reference Shared folder structure
- [ ] Shared folder contains working GLB models (not problematic FBX)
- [ ] All tests pass without missing asset errors
- [ ] Format comparison test shows organized structure
- [ ] Tree isolated test loads from Shared folder
- [ ] Asset pack tests pass with proper asset counts

**Note**: This integration ensures that all PSX assets are consistently organized and shared between regions, making the codebase more maintainable and efficient.
