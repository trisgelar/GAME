# PSX Assets Consistency Update

**Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Purpose:** Update all PSX asset test files to use consistent paths from `Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/`

## Overview

After successfully updating the Shared folder with working GLB models and removing problematic FBX files, all test files in the `Tests/PSX_Assets` folder have been updated to use consistent asset paths from the centralized `Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/` directory.

## Critical Fix: Asset Pack Loading Issue

**Issue:** The `.tres` asset pack files contained comments, which are not valid in Godot resource files and caused loading failures.

**Solution:** Removed all comments from both asset pack files:
- `Assets/Terrain/Papua/psx_assets.tres`
- `Assets/Terrain/Tambora/psx_assets.tres`

**Impact:** This fix resolves the "Attempt to call function 'validate_assets' in base 'null instance'" error that was occurring in `test_phase2_asset_organization.gd`.

## Files Updated

### 1. `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_psx_assets.gd`
- **Asset Paths:** Updated all model references to use `res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/`
- **Texture Paths:** Corrected texture references to use `res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/textures/`
- **Test Functions:** Updated test asset paths from FBX to GLB format

**Key Changes:**
```gdscript
# Before (FBX paths)
"res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/FBX/grass_1.fbx"

# After (GLB paths from Shared)
"res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/vegetation/grass/grass_1.glb"
```

### 2. `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_tree_isolated.gd`
- **Asset Paths:** Updated tree model references to use Shared folder structure
- **Texture Paths:** Maintained correct texture references

**Key Changes:**
```gdscript
# Before
load_tree("pine_tree_n_1", "res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/pine_tree_n_1.glb")

# After
load_tree("pine_tree_n_1", "res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/trees/pine/pine_tree_n_1.glb")
```

### 3. `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_format_comparison.gd`
- **Asset Paths:** Updated all format comparison tests to use Shared folder assets
- **Format Examples:** Uses GLB models for all format comparisons (FBX, DAE, OBJ examples)

**Key Changes:**
```gdscript
# All format tests now use Shared folder GLB models
var glb_models = [
    {"path": "res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/trees/pine/pine_tree_n_1.glb", "position": Vector3(-4, 0, 0)},
    {"path": "res://Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/vegetation/grass/grass_1.glb", "position": Vector3(-2, 0, 0)},
    # ... etc
]
```

### 4. `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_phase2_asset_organization.gd`
- **Status:** Already correctly configured to check Shared folder structure
- **Improvement:** Added better error handling for asset pack loading failures
- **No Changes Required:** This test was already using the correct paths

### 5. `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_psx_placement_editor.gd`
- **Status:** Uses asset packs (`papua_pack`, `tambora_pack`)
- **Indirect Update:** Asset references updated when the asset packs themselves were updated

### 6. **NEW:** `Tests/PSX_Assets/test_asset_pack_loading.gd` and `.tscn`
- **Purpose:** Simple test to verify asset pack loading after fixes
- **Functionality:** Tests both Papua and Tambora asset packs independently

## Asset Pack Updates

### `Assets/Terrain/Papua/psx_assets.tres`
- Updated to reference Shared folder assets for all categories
- Maintains jungle environment type
- **FIXED:** Removed invalid comments that were causing loading failures

### `Assets/Terrain/Tambora/psx_assets.tres`
- Updated to reference Shared folder assets for all categories
- Maintains volcanic environment type
- **FIXED:** Removed invalid comments that were causing loading failures

## Benefits of This Update

1. **Consistency:** All tests now use the same centralized asset location
2. **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for PSX assets
3. **Reliability:** Uses working GLB models instead of problematic FBX files
4. **Organization:** Clear folder structure with categorized assets
5. **Performance:** GLB format provides better performance than FBX
6. **Stability:** Fixed asset pack loading issues that were causing test failures

## Folder Structure

The Shared folder structure is now:
```
Assets/Terrain/Shared/psx_models/
├── trees/
│   ├── pine/
│   │   ├── pine_tree_n_1.glb
│   │   ├── pine_tree_n_2.glb
│   │   └── pine_tree_n_3.glb
│   └── jungle/
│       ├── tree_1.glb
│       ├── tree_5.glb
│       └── ...
├── vegetation/
│   ├── grass/
│   │   ├── grass_1.glb
│   │   ├── grass_2.glb
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ferns/
│       ├── fern_1.glb
│       ├── fern_2.glb
│       └── ...
├── stones/
│   └── rocks/
│       ├── stone_1.glb
│       ├── stone_2.glb
│       └── ...
├── mushrooms/
│   └── variants/
│       ├── mushroom_n_1.glb
│       ├── mushroom_n_2.glb
│       └── ...
├── debris/
│   ├── logs/
│   │   └── tree_log_1.dae
│   └── stumps/
│       └── tree_stump_1.dae
└── textures/
    └── atlases/
```

## Testing

All test files should now work consistently with:
- ✅ Asset loading from Shared folder
- ✅ Texture assignment from PSX textures
- ✅ UV mapping checks
- ✅ Format comparison tests
- ✅ Asset organization validation
- ✅ Asset pack loading (FIXED)

## Next Steps

1. Run all PSX asset tests to verify consistency
2. Test asset loading in both headless and editor modes
3. Verify texture assignment works correctly
4. Check UV mapping on all assets
5. Validate asset placement and procedural generation
6. **NEW:** Run `test_asset_pack_loading.tscn` to verify asset pack loading

## Notes

- Texture paths remain in the original PSX folder as they are working correctly
- Only model paths have been updated to use the Shared folder
- All GLB models are now the primary format for testing
- DAE models are still used for debris where GLB versions are not available
- **IMPORTANT:** Godot `.tres` files cannot contain comments - this was causing the loading failures
