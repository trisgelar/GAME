# PSX Model Formats Guide for Godot Development

## 📁 Available Model Formats

Your PSX Nature assets come in **4 different formats**, each with their own advantages and use cases:

### 🎯 1. GLB (GL Binary) - **RECOMMENDED** ⭐
**Location**: `Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/`

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Most efficient** file sizes
- ✅ **Embedded textures** (no separate texture files needed)
- ✅ **Better performance** in Godot
- ✅ **Web-ready** (perfect for web exports)
- ✅ **Modern format** designed for real-time applications
- ✅ **Single file** contains everything (model + textures)

**Best for:** Production games, especially web/mobile exports

**Example file sizes:**
- `pine_tree_n_1.glb`: ~350KB (includes textures)
- `grass_1.glb`: ~94KB (includes textures)
- `stone_1.glb`: ~2.1MB (includes high-res textures)

### 📦 2. FBX (Autodesk Filmbox)
**Location**: `Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/FBX/`

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Industry standard format
- ✅ Good compatibility with 3D software
- ✅ Supports animations
- ✅ Widely supported

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Larger file sizes
- ❌ Proprietary format
- ❌ Requires separate texture files

**Best for:** Complex models with animations, when working with 3D software

**Example file sizes:**
- `pine_tree_n_1.fbx`: ~61KB (textures separate)
- `grass_1.fbx`: ~19KB (textures separate)

---

### 🎨 3. DAE (COLLADA)
**Location**: `Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/DAE/`

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Open standard format
- ✅ Good texture support
- ✅ Widely supported
- ✅ Good for complex materials

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Can be larger than optimized formats
- ❌ Requires separate texture files

**Best for:** Models with complex materials and textures

**Example file sizes:**
- `pine_tree_n_1.dae`: ~198KB (textures separate)
- `grass_1.dae`: ~5KB (textures separate)

---

### 📐 4. OBJ (Wavefront)
**Location**: `Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/OBJ/`

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Simple, universal compatibility
- ✅ Small file sizes
- ✅ Easy to work with
- ✅ Human-readable format

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Limited material support
- ❌ No animations
- ❌ Requires separate material files (.mtl)

**Best for:** Simple static models, prototyping

**Example file sizes:**
- `pine_tree_n_1.obj`: ~101KB (materials separate)
- `grass_1.obj`: ~1KB (materials separate)

## 🎮 Recommendations for Godot Development

### **For Production Games: Use GLB** ⭐
```gdscript
# Recommended path for trees
"res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/pine_tree_n_1.glb"

# Recommended path for vegetation
"res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/grass_1.glb"

# Recommended path for stones
"res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/stone_1.glb"
```

**Why GLB is best:**
1. **Performance**: Smaller file sizes = faster loading
2. **Simplicity**: One file contains everything
3. **Web-ready**: Perfect for web exports
4. **Modern**: Designed for real-time applications

### **For Development/Testing: Use OBJ**
```gdscript
# Good for quick testing
"res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/OBJ/pine_tree_n_1.obj"
```

**Why OBJ for testing:**
1. **Fast loading**: Smallest file sizes
2. **Simple**: Easy to debug
3. **Universal**: Works everywhere

## 🔧 How to Test Different Formats

### 1. **Format Comparison Test**
Run the format comparison test scene:
```
Tests/PSX_Assets/test_format_comparison.tscn
```

This will let you:
- Load models from different formats side by side
- Compare file sizes and loading performance
- See visual differences between formats

### 2. **Updated PSX Asset Test**
The main PSX asset test now uses GLB models by default:
```
Tests/PSX_Assets/test_psx_assets.tscn
```

### 3. **Isolated Tree Test**
Test tree models specifically:
```
Tests/PSX_Assets/test_tree_isolated.tscn
```

## 📊 File Size Comparison

| Model | GLB | FBX | DAE | OBJ |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Pine Tree 1 | ~350KB | ~61KB | ~198KB | ~101KB |
| Grass 1 | ~94KB | ~19KB | ~5KB | ~1KB |
| Stone 1 | ~2.1MB | N/A | N/A | ~7KB |
| Mushroom 1 | ~98KB | ~26KB | ~32KB | ~14KB |

**Note:** GLB includes embedded textures, while others require separate texture files.

## 🚀 Performance Tips

### 1. **Use GLB for Production**
```gdscript
# Good for production
var tree_path = "res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/pine_tree_n_1.glb"
```

### 2. **Use OBJ for Development**
```gdscript
# Good for development/testing
var tree_path = "res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/OBJ/pine_tree_n_1.obj"
```

### 3. **Batch Loading**
```gdscript
# Load multiple models efficiently
var model_paths = [
    "res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/pine_tree_n_1.glb",
    "res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/pine_tree_n_2.glb",
    "res://Assets/PSX/PSX Nature/Models/GLB/pine_tree_n_3.glb"
]
```

## 🎯 Summary

**For your Walking Simulator game:**

1. **Use GLB models** for the final game - they're the most efficient
2. **Use OBJ models** during development for faster iteration
3. **Test with the format comparison tool** to see the differences
4. **GLB models come with embedded textures** - no need to manage separate texture files

The GLB format will give you the best performance and easiest workflow for your Godot game!
