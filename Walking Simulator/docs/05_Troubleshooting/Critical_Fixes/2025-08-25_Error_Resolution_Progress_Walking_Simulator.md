# Error Resolution Progress - Walking Simulator
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Project:** Walking Simulator (Godot 4.3.stable)  
**Last Updated:** August 25, 2025

## Current Status
**Latest Approach:** Simplified movement system based on working walking simulator example.

## Error History and Resolution

### Error 1: Input Actions Not Registering
**Problem:** Character could not walk, only move left and right automatically like a glitch. Console was spammed with "Final velocity" messages.

**Root Cause:** Input actions in `project.godot` had `"pressed":false` instead of `"pressed":true`.

**Solution:** 
- Changed all relevant input actions in `project.godot` to `"pressed":true`
- Added programmatic input setup in `PlayerController.gd`
- Added input clearing with `Input.flush_buffered_events()`

**Files Modified:**
- `project.godot` - Fixed input action configurations
- `Player Controller/PlayerController.gd` - Added input setup and clearing

### Error 2: NPC Interaction Spam
**Problem:** NPC interaction was spamming "Press E to talk..." messages continuously.

**Root Cause:** `CulturalNPC` was inheriting from `CharacterBody3D` instead of `CulturalInteractableObject`, causing duplicate interaction logic.

**Solution:**
- Changed `CulturalNPC` inheritance from `CharacterBody3D` to `CulturalInteractableObject`
- Updated interaction prompt logic
- Removed redundant functions and duplicate exports
- Changed NPC node type in scene from `CharacterBody3D` to `Node3D`

**Files Modified:**
- `Systems/NPCs/CulturalNPC.gd` - Fixed inheritance and interaction logic
- `Scenes/IndonesiaBarat/PasarScene.tscn` - Updated NPC node type

### Error 3: Persistent Movement Glitches
**Problem:** Character exhibited automatic left/right movement from startup, even after input configuration fixes.

**Root Cause:** Complex physics interactions and aggressive stabilization logic preventing intended movement.

**Solution (Iterative):**
1. **Initial Fix:** Replaced `Input.get_vector()` with individual `Input.is_action_pressed()` checks
2. **Input Filtering:** Added input deadzone and state tracking
3. **Physics Stabilization:** Implemented position locking and reversion systems
4. **Ground Stabilization:** Added startup physics settling

**Files Modified:**
- `Player Controller/PlayerController.gd` - Complete movement system overhaul

### Error 4: Character Not Moving After Input
**Problem:** After fixing glitches, character would not respond to movement keys at all.

**Root Cause:** Position reversion logic was too aggressive, reverting all horizontal movement even when intended by player input.

**Solution:** Modified position reversion logic to only apply when there is no player input (`move_input == Vector2.ZERO` and `velocity.x == 0` and `velocity.z == 0`).

### Error 5: Horizontal Sliding During Forward/Backward Movement
**Problem:** When using W or S, character would slide left and right instead of moving forward/backward.

**Root Cause:** Perpendicular movement reversion was too aggressive and movement direction calculation was complex.

**Solution:**
- Simplified movement direction calculation
- Improved ground stabilization
- Added perpendicular movement reversion during active input

### Error 6: Current Movement Issues (August 25, 2025)
**Problem:** 
- W and S input results in no movement
- A and D input results in slight movement followed by reversion to previous position
- Debug shows persistent "Character is not on floor!" warnings

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Ground stabilization is still failing at startup
2. Perpendicular movement reversion is too aggressive (threshold 0.01)
3. Position tracking logic is flawed

**Latest Solution (August 25, 2025):**
1. **Improved Ground Stabilization:**
   - Start character above ground level (y=10.0)
   - Apply gravity until floor is reached
   - Use proper physics frames for settling
   - Added initialization flag to prevent processing until ready

2. **Less Aggressive Perpendicular Movement Reversion:**
   - Increased threshold from 0.01 to 0.05 for unwanted movement detection
   - Only revert significant unwanted perpendicular movement
   - Simplified logic for determining primary movement direction

3. **Fixed Position Tracking:**
   - Removed problematic `last_position` update logic during no-input periods
   - Only update `last_position` during active movement
   - Added initialization check to prevent processing before stabilization

**Files Modified:**
- `Player Controller/PlayerController.gd` - Complete movement system refinement

### Error 7: Simplified Approach (August 25, 2025)
**Problem:** Complex movement system with multiple stabilization layers was causing more problems than it solved.

**Root Cause:** Over-engineering the movement system instead of using proven, simple approaches.

**Latest Solution (August 25, 2025):**
**Complete System Simplification:**
1. **Replaced Complex Movement System:**
   - Removed all input filtering, position locking, and stabilization logic
   - Replaced with simple `Input.get_vector()` approach from working example
   - Removed all debug output and complex physics handling

2. **Fixed Input Configuration:**
   - Changed all input actions back to `"pressed":false` (correct setting)
   - Matched configuration with working walking simulator example

3. **Clean Movement Logic:**
   - Simple `Input.get_vector("move_left", "move_right", "move_forward", "move_back")`
   - Standard `transform.basis` movement direction calculation
   - Basic `lerp()` velocity smoothing
   - No position reversion or stabilization

**Files Modified:**
- `Player Controller/PlayerController.gd` - Complete rewrite based on working example
- `project.godot` - Fixed input action configurations

## Technical Details

### Key Changes in Latest Fix:
```gdscript
# Simple movement system based on working example
var move_input = Input.get_vector("move_left", "move_right", "move_forward", "move_back")
var move_dir = (transform.basis * Vector3(move_input.x, 0, move_input.y)).normalized()

# Standard velocity smoothing
velocity.x = lerp(velocity.x, target_vel.x, current_smoothing * delta)
velocity.z = lerp(velocity.z, target_vel.z, current_smoothing * delta)

move_and_slide()
```

### What Was Removed:
- All input filtering and deadzone logic
- Position locking and reversion systems
- Ground stabilization and initialization checks
- Perpendicular movement detection and correction
- Complex debug output and state tracking
- Programmatic input setup and clearing

### What Was Kept:
- Basic movement with WASD keys
- Jumping with spacebar
- Sprinting with shift
- Camera mouse look
- Gravity and physics

## Next Steps
1. Test the simplified movement system
2. If movement works properly, gradually add back NPC interactions
3. Add back other features one by one to ensure stability
4. Document any additional issues that arise

## Files Involved
- `Player Controller/PlayerController.gd` - Simplified player movement controller
- `project.godot` - Corrected input action configurations
- `Systems/NPCs/CulturalNPC.gd` - NPC interaction system (temporarily disabled)
- `Scenes/IndonesiaBarat/PasarScene.tscn` - Main scene with NPCs

## Notes
- All documentation has been moved to the `docs/` folder
- Date formats have been corrected to reflect actual dates (August 2025)
- The movement system has been completely simplified based on the working walking simulator example
- Current focus is on getting basic movement working before adding complex features
- This approach follows the principle of "keep it simple, stupid" (KISS)
