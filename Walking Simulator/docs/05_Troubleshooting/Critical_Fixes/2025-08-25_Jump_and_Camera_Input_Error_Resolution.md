# Jump and Camera Input Error Resolution Documentation

**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Project:** Walking Simulator - Indonesian Cultural Heritage Exhibition  
**Issues Resolved:** Player jumping not working, Mouse camera control not working in region scenes

## Overview

This document details the debugging and resolution process for two critical input issues in the Walking Simulator game:
1. **Jump Issue:** Player could not jump despite spacebar input being detected
2. **Camera Issue:** Mouse input for camera control was not working in region scenes (PasarScene, TamboraScene, PapuaScene)

## Issue 1: Jump Functionality Not Working

### Problem Description
- Player could not jump when pressing spacebar
- Log showed "Not on floor - applying gravity" continuously
- Spacebar input was detected but no jump action occurred
- Player kept falling due to gravity being applied constantly

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Initial Investigation
1. **Log Analysis:** Examined `log/2025_08_25_15_22_Movement.log`
   - Found continuous "Not on floor - applying gravity" messages
   - Spacebar presses were detected: `*** SPACEBAR DETECTED ***`
   - No corresponding jump actions were triggered

2. **Code Analysis:** Reviewed `PlayerController.gd`
   ```gdscript
   if Input.is_action_pressed("jump") and is_on_floor():
       velocity.y = jump_force
   ```
   - Jump condition required `is_on_floor()` to be true
   - Player was never detected as being on the floor

#### Root Cause Identified
The jump logic was checking `is_on_floor()` which requires proper physics collision detection, but the player controller uses manual position manipulation instead of physics-based movement. This created a mismatch where the player was never detected as being on the floor.

### Solution Implementation

#### Modified Jump Logic
Updated `PlayerController.gd` to use manual ground detection:

```gdscript
# Jumping with debug - Check both action and direct key
# Modified to work with manual movement system
var is_on_ground = position.y <= 1.1  # Manual ground detection

if Input.is_action_pressed("jump") and is_on_ground:
    velocity.y = jump_force
    print("*** JUMP ACTION! ***")
elif Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_SPACE) and is_on_ground:
    velocity.y = jump_force
    print("*** JUMP KEY! ***")
```

#### Key Changes
1. **Manual Ground Detection:** Replaced `is_on_floor()` with `position.y <= 1.1`
2. **Consistent with Movement System:** Aligned with the existing manual position manipulation approach
3. **Debug Output:** Added print statements to confirm jump actions

### Testing Results
- ✅ Jump functionality now works correctly
- ✅ Player can jump when on ground level (Y ≤ 1.1)
- ✅ Both spacebar and jump action work
- ✅ Jump force is properly applied to velocity.y

## Issue 2: Mouse Camera Control Not Working in Region Scenes

### Problem Description
- Mouse input for camera control worked in `main.tscn` (template scene)
- Mouse input did not work in region scenes (`PasarScene.tscn`, `TamboraScene.tscn`, `PapuaScene.tscn`)
- Player movement (WASD) worked, but camera rotation did not respond to mouse movement

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Initial Investigation
1. **Scene Comparison:** Compared `main.tscn` with `PasarScene.tscn`
   - Both scenes used the same `Player.tscn` instance
   - Both had proper collision objects
   - Region scenes had additional UI elements

2. **UI Analysis:** Examined UI components in region scenes
   - `CulturalInfoPanel`: Control node covering entire screen
   - `CulturalInventory`: Control node covering entire screen
   - Both had `anchors_preset = 15` (full screen coverage)

3. **Input Handling:** Reviewed input processing
   - Player controller uses `_unhandled_input()` for mouse events
   - UI elements were intercepting mouse input before it reached the player

#### Root Cause Identified
The UI elements (`CulturalInfoPanel` and `CulturalInventory`) were `Control` nodes covering the entire screen with default `MOUSE_FILTER_STOP` behavior, which blocked mouse input from reaching the player controller.

### Solution Implementation

#### Fix 1: CulturalInfoPanel.gd
```gdscript
func _ready():
    # Set mouse filter to ignore when panel is hidden
    mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE

func _on_show_cultural_info(info_data: Dictionary):
    # Show the panel
    info_panel.visible = true
    # Allow mouse input when panel is visible
    mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_STOP

func _on_hide_cultural_info():
    info_panel.visible = false
    # Ignore mouse input when panel is hidden
    mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE
```

#### Fix 2: CulturalInventory.gd
```gdscript
func _ready():
    # Set mouse filter to ignore when inventory is hidden
    mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE

func toggle_window(open: bool):
    if open:
        Input.mouse_mode = Input.MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE
        # Allow mouse input when inventory is open
        mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_STOP
    else:
        Input.mouse_mode = Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED
        # Ignore mouse input when inventory is closed
        mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE
```

#### Key Changes
1. **Dynamic Mouse Filter:** UI elements only capture mouse input when visible
2. **Input Pass-through:** Mouse events pass through to player controller when UI is hidden
3. **Proper State Management:** Mouse mode and filter settings synchronized with UI visibility

### Testing Results
- ✅ Mouse camera control now works in all region scenes
- ✅ UI panels still capture mouse input when visible
- ✅ Inventory toggle (I key) works without blocking mouse input
- ✅ Player movement and jumping work normally

## Technical Details

### Mouse Filter Modes
- **MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE:** Input passes through to child nodes
- **MOUSE_FILTER_STOP:** Input is captured and stops propagation
- **MOUSE_FILTER_PASS:** Input is captured but allows propagation

### Input Processing Order
1. UI elements with `MOUSE_FILTER_STOP` capture input first
2. Player controller's `_unhandled_input()` only receives input that wasn't captured
3. By setting UI elements to `MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE` when hidden, input reaches the player

### Ground Detection Methods
- **Physics-based:** `is_on_floor()` - requires proper collision detection
- **Manual:** `position.y <= threshold` - works with manual movement systems

## Prevention Measures

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Check UI element mouse filter settings
- [ ] Verify input processing order
- [ ] Test input functionality in all scenes
- [ ] Ensure consistent movement system approach

### Best Practices
1. **UI Design:** Use `MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE` for full-screen UI elements when hidden
2. **Input Handling:** Test input in all scene variations
3. **Movement Systems:** Choose consistent approach (physics vs manual)
4. **Debug Logging:** Add input detection logging for troubleshooting
