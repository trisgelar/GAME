# Interaction System Fixes - 2025-08-26

## Issues Identified from Log Analysis

### 1. RayCast Direction Problem
**Problem**: InteractionController RayCast was pointing downward instead of forward
**Log Evidence**: 
```
[INFO] RayCast target position: (0, 0, -2)
[DEBUG] RayCast hit: GroundCollision (Type: StaticBody3D)
```
**Fix**: Changed RayCast target_position from `(0, 0, -2)` to `(0, 0, -3)`

### 2. NPC Player Detection Failure
**Problem**: All NPCs failed to find the player
**Log Evidence**:
```
[WARNING] NPC MarketGuide could not find player
[WARNING] NPC FoodVendor could not find player
[WARNING] NPC CraftVendor could not find player
[WARNING] NPC Historian could not find player
```
**Root Cause**: NPCs were looking for `CulturalPlayerController` but player is `CharacterBody3D`
**Fix**: Updated player detection to look for `CharacterBody3D` in "player" group

### 3. Area Detection Type Mismatch
**Problem**: Area3D signals were checking for wrong player type
**Fix**: Updated area detection to use `CharacterBody3D` instead of `CulturalPlayerController`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Player.tscn - RayCast Direction
```gdscript
# Before
target_position = Vector3(0, 0, -2)

# After  
target_position = Vector3(0, 0, -3)
```

### 2. CulturalNPC.gd - Player Detection
```gdscript
# Before
if player_node and player_node is CulturalPlayerController:

# After
if player_node and player_node is CharacterBody3D:
```

### 3. CulturalNPC.gd - Area Detection
```gdscript
# Before
if body is CulturalPlayerController:

# After
if body is CharacterBody3D and body.is_in_group("player"):
```

## Expected Results After Fixes

1. **RayCast will hit NPCs and artifacts** instead of just ground/walls
2. **NPCs will detect the player** when they enter interaction range
3. **Interaction prompts will appear** when approaching NPCs
4. **Area3D signals will work** for visual feedback
5. **Collision detection will work** (no more "menembus" objects)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run the game** and load Pasar scene
2. **Walk around** - you should now hit walls and stalls
3. **Approach NPCs** - you should see "[E] Talk to [NPC Name]" prompts
4. **Press E** - NPC dialogue should start
5. **Approach artifacts** - you should see collection prompts
6. **Check new log file** - should show successful player detection and interaction

## Log Verification

After fixes, the log should show:
```
[INFO] NPC MarketGuide found player: Player
[INFO] Player entered interaction range of MarketGuide
[DEBUG] Found CulturalInteractableObject: MarketGuide
[INFO] Near interactable: MarketGuide - [E] Talk to MarketGuide
```
