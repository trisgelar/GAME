# Type Mismatch Fix - 2025-08-26

## Error Description
```
Trying to assign value of type 'PlayerControllerFixed.gd' to a variable of type 'PlayerController.gd'
```

## Root Cause
The `CulturalNPC.gd` script had a type mismatch in the player variable declaration:

```gdscript
# Before (INCORRECT)
var player: CulturalPlayerController
```

The script was trying to assign a `CharacterBody3D` (the actual player node) to a variable typed as `CulturalPlayerController`.

## Fix Applied
Changed the variable type to match what we're actually assigning:

```gdscript
# After (CORRECT)
var player: CharacterBody3D
```

## Location
- **File**: `Systems/NPCs/CulturalNPC.gd`
- **Line**: 15
- **Function**: Variable declaration

## Why This Happened
1. The original code was written expecting the player to be a `CulturalPlayerController`
2. However, the actual player node in the scene is a `CharacterBody3D` with the script attached
3. When we updated the player detection logic, we changed it to look for `CharacterBody3D` but forgot to update the variable type

## Verification
After this fix:
- No more type mismatch errors
- NPCs can properly detect and reference the player
- All player detection logic will work correctly

## Testing
Run the game and check that:
1. No type mismatch errors appear
2. NPCs can find the player successfully
3. Interaction system works as expected
