# Papua Scene Movement & Camera Fixes - 2025-09-04

## 🎯 **Overview**
Successfully resolved critical movement and camera issues in PapuaScene_TerrainAssets, transforming it from a broken scene to a fully functional 3D environment with proper player controls and visible objects.

## 🚨 **Problems Solved Today**

### 1. **WASD Movement Not Working**
- **Issue**: Player couldn't move despite input being detected
- **Root Cause**: Camera node references were incorrect (`CameraArm` vs `SpringArm3D`)
- **Solution**: Implemented robust camera node resolution with fallback detection
- **Result**: ✅ WASD movement now fully functional

### 2. **Camera Not Working / Orange Screen**
- **Issue**: Camera was looking at sky/orange background instead of scene
- **Root Cause**: Complex camera transforms were pointing camera in wrong direction
- **Solution**: Reset camera rotations to `Vector3.ZERO` and proper initialization
- **Result**: ✅ Camera now shows proper 3D first-person view

### 3. **Invisible Objects (NPCs, Trees, Artifacts)**
- **Issue**: All objects were invisible despite being in scene
- **Root Cause**: Objects had `MeshInstance3D` nodes but no mesh assigned
- **Solution**: Added proper meshes to all objects
- **Result**: ✅ All objects now visible as colored boxes

### 4. **Massive Orange Blocks Covering Scene**
- **Issue**: Huge orange blocks covering entire scene
- **Root Cause**: All objects were using massive 200x200 unit `BoxMesh_ground`
- **Solution**: Created properly sized meshes for different object types
- **Result**: ✅ Objects now properly sized and positioned

### 5. **UI Interference with Input**
- **Issue**: UI buttons were capturing mouse input, preventing camera control
- **Solution**: Temporarily hid UI elements, then restored with proper mouse mode handling
- **Result**: ✅ M key toggles mouse mode between captured/visible

## 🔧 **Technical Solutions Implemented**

### **Camera System Architecture**
```
Player (CharacterBody3D)
├── CameraPivot (Node3D)
│   ├── SpringArm3D (SpringArm3D) - Camera arm
│   │   └── Camera3D (Camera3D) - Actual camera
│   └── [Alternative: CameraArm for different scenes]
```

### **Robust Camera Resolution Code**
```gdscript
# Try CameraArm first (for Fixed scene)
if has_node("CameraPivot/CameraArm"):
    camera_arm = get_node("CameraPivot/CameraArm") as SpringArm3D
    camera = get_node("CameraPivot/CameraArm/Camera3D") as Camera3D
# Try SpringArm3D (for TerrainAssets scene)
elif has_node("CameraPivot/SpringArm3D"):
    camera_arm = get_node("CameraPivot/SpringArm3D") as SpringArm3D
    camera = get_node("CameraPivot/SpringArm3D/Camera3D") as Camera3D
```

### **Proper Mesh Sizing System**
```gdscript
# Different meshes for different object types
BoxMesh_ground: Vector3(200, 1, 200)  # For terrain
BoxMesh_tree: Vector3(1, 3, 1)        # For trees
BoxMesh_npc: Vector3(1, 2, 1)         # For NPCs
BoxMesh_small: Vector3(1, 1, 1)       # For artifacts
```

### **Mouse Mode Toggle System**
```gdscript
# M key toggles mouse mode
if event.keycode == KEY_M:
    if Input.get_mouse_mode() == Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED:
        Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE)
    else:
        Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)
```

## 🎮 **Current Controls**
- **WASD** - Move player
- **Mouse** - Look around (when captured)
- **M** - Toggle mouse mode (captured ↔ visible)
- **Shift** - Run
- **Space** - Jump
- **ESC** - Exit game

## 📈 **Performance Improvements**
- **Reduced debug logging** - From 331k+ lines to manageable size
- **Optimized input processing** - Only log when there's actual input
- **Efficient camera resolution** - Single-pass node detection

## 🔍 **Debug Features Added**
- Camera position and rotation logging
- Input detection debugging
- Mouse delta tracking
- Movement input validation

## ✅ **Current Status**
- **Movement**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Camera**: ✅ Proper first-person view
- **Objects**: ✅ All visible and properly sized
- **UI**: ✅ Functional with mouse mode toggle
- **Performance**: ✅ Optimized logging and processing

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
See `2025-09-04_Terrain3D_Integration_Plan.md` for tomorrow's development plan focusing on Terrain3D integration, multi-view camera system, and enhanced radar functionality.

## 📝 **Lessons Learned**
1. **Scene structure matters** - Proper node hierarchy is crucial for functionality
2. **Mesh sizing is critical** - Using wrong mesh sizes can break entire scenes
3. **Camera resolution needs fallbacks** - Different scenes may use different node names
4. **Debug logging should be conditional** - Excessive logging can impact performance
5. **UI and input conflicts** - Need proper mouse mode management for UI interaction

## 🔧 **Files Modified**
- `Player Controller/PlayerControllerIntegrated.gd` - Camera resolution, input handling, mouse sensitivity
- `Scenes/IndonesiaTimur/PapuaScene_TerrainAssets.tscn` - Object meshes, UI visibility, camera setup
- `Tests/Experimental_Papua_Scenes/Scene_Variations/PapuaScene_Fixed.tscn` - UI updates (moved to experimental folder)
- `Scenes/IndonesiaTimur/PapuaScene.tscn` - UI updates
