# Pasar Scene Interaction Fix - 2025-08-26

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Collision Bodies
**Problem**: Player could walk through NPCs and objects ("menembus" objects)
**Root Cause**: NPCs and market stalls were missing collision bodies (CharacterBody3D/StaticBody3D)

### 2. Missing Interaction Areas
**Problem**: No interaction prompts when near NPCs
**Root Cause**: NPCs had visual models but no proper collision detection for interaction

### 3. Cultural Artifacts Not Collectible
**Problem**: Recipe items couldn't be collected
**Root Cause**: Missing collision bodies on cultural artifacts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Collision Bodies to NPCs
```gdscript
[node name="NPCCollision" type="CharacterBody3D" parent="NPCs/MarketGuide"]
[node name="CollisionShape3D" type="CollisionShape3D" parent="NPCs/MarketGuide/NPCCollision"]
shape = SubResource("BoxShape3D_wall")
```

**Applied to**:
- MarketGuide (center of scene)
- FoodVendor (near Stall1)
- CraftVendor (near Stall2) 
- Historian (near Stall3)

### 2. Added Interaction Areas to NPCs
```gdscript
[node name="InteractionArea" type="Area3D" parent="NPCs/MarketGuide"]
[node name="CollisionShape3D" type="CollisionShape3D" parent="NPCs/MarketGuide/InteractionArea"]
shape = SubResource("BoxShape3D_wall")
```

### 3. Added Collision Bodies to Market Stalls
```gdscript
[node name="Stall1Collision" type="StaticBody3D" parent="Environment/MarketStalls"]
[node name="CollisionShape3D" type="CollisionShape3D" parent="Environment/MarketStalls/Stall1Collision"]
transform = Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, -10, 1, -10)
shape = SubResource("BoxShape3D_wall")
```

### 4. Added Collision Bodies to Cultural Artifacts
```gdscript
[node name="SotoRecipeCollision" type="StaticBody3D" parent="CulturalArtifacts"]
[node name="CollisionShape3D" type="CollisionShape3D" parent="CulturalArtifacts/SotoRecipeCollision"]
transform = Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, -8, 1.5, -8)
shape = SubResource("BoxShape3D_wall")
```

## NPC Locations in Pasar Scene

### 1. MarketGuide (Center)
- **Position**: (0, 1, 0) - Center of the market
- **Type**: Guide
- **Function**: Provides general market information and guidance

- **Position**: (-10, 1, -10) - Near the first stall
- **Type**: Vendor
- **Function**: Sells traditional Indonesian food
- **Interaction**: "Talk to FoodVendor"

### 3. CraftVendor (Near Stall2)

## Cultural Artifacts (Recipes)

### 1. SotoRecipe
- **Position**: (-8, 1.5, -8)
- **Type**: Traditional Soto recipe

## How to Test

1. **Movement**: Walk around the scene - you should now hit walls and stalls
2. **NPC Interaction**: Approach any NPC and press E to talk
3. **Artifact Collection**: Approach any green cylinder and press E to collect
4. **Visual Feedback**: NPCs should show yellow tint when you're in range

## Technical Details

### Interaction System Flow
1. **Player approaches NPC/Artifact**
2. **RayCast3D detects CulturalInteractableObject**
3. **InteractionController shows prompt "[E] Talk to [NPC Name]"**
4. **Player presses E**
5. **NPC._interact() is called**
6. **Dialogue system activates**

### Collision Layers
- **StaticBody3D**: For walls, stalls, and artifacts (immovable)
- **CharacterBody3D**: For NPCs (can be moved if needed)
- **Area3D**: For interaction detection zones

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Player cannot walk through objects**
✅ **Interaction prompts appear when near NPCs**
✅ **Cultural artifacts can be collected**
✅ **NPCs respond to interaction with dialogue**
✅ **Visual feedback when in interaction range**
