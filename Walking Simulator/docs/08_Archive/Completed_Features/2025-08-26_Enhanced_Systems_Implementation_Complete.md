- `CulturalActionCommand`: Handles cultural learning actions
- Extensible for future command types

### 4. Enhanced Player Controller

#### Movement System
- **Fixed Movement**: Resolved all movement issues across scenes
- **Smooth Controls**: Improved acceleration and braking
- **Camera Integration**: Proper mouse look with sensitivity controls
- **Debug Mode**: Comprehensive debugging information

#### Command Integration
- **Command Manager**: Integrated with player controller
- **Input Handling**: Undo/redo input processing
- **Event Emission**: Player actions trigger appropriate events

### 5. Enhanced UI Systems

#### Dialogue UI
- **Dynamic Dialogue Display**: Shows NPC dialogue with options
- **Interactive Buttons**: Player can select dialogue options
- **Consequence Handling**: Dialogue choices have consequences
- **Event Integration**: Connected to Event Bus for system communication

#### Cultural Info Panel
- **Information Display**: Shows cultural information learned
- **Region-Specific Content**: Displays region-appropriate information
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Updates based on player actions

### 6. Comprehensive Testing

#### Test Suite
- **NPC Dialogue Testing**: Verifies dialogue system functionality
- **Event Bus Testing**: Tests event emission and subscription
- **Command Manager Testing**: Verifies undo/redo functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Tests system interactions

#### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ NPC creation and dialogue setup
- ‚úÖ Event Bus singleton accessibility
- ‚úÖ Command execution and undo/redo
- ‚úÖ System integration verification

## üéÆ How to Use the Enhanced Systems

### Player Controls
- **Movement**: WASD keys for movement
- **Jump**: Spacebar
- **Sprint**: Shift key
- **Interact**: E key (near NPCs or artifacts)
- **Inventory**: I key
- **Undo**: Ctrl+Z
- **Redo**: Ctrl+Y
- **Mouse Look**: Move mouse to look around
- **Escape**: Toggle mouse capture

### NPC Interaction
1. **Approach NPC**: Walk near any NPC in the scenes
2. **Press E**: Interact with the NPC
3. **Choose Dialogue**: Select from available dialogue options
4. **Learn Culture**: NPCs will share cultural knowledge
5. **Collect Artifacts**: Find and collect cultural artifacts

### Undo/Redo System
- **Collect Artifacts**: Use E to collect artifacts
- **Undo Collection**: Press Ctrl+Z to undo artifact collection
- **Redo Collection**: Press Ctrl+Y to redo artifact collection
- **View History**: Check console for command history

## üìä System Performance

### Event Bus Performance
- **Queue Size**: Maximum 100 events in queue
- **Processing**: High-priority events processed immediately
- **Memory Management**: Automatic queue cleanup
- **Statistics**: Event processing and drop statistics available

### Command Manager Performance
- **History Size**: Maximum 50 commands in history
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient command storage
- **Undo/Redo Speed**: Instant command reversal
- **State Management**: Proper state restoration

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### SOLID Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility**: Each system has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Systems are open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: NPC types can be substituted without breaking functionality
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean interfaces for each system
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules

### Design Patterns Used
- **Observer Pattern**: Event Bus for decoupled communication
- **Command Pattern**: Undo/redo functionality
- **State Pattern**: NPC behavior states
- **Factory Pattern**: Cultural item creation
- **Singleton Pattern**: Event Bus singleton
