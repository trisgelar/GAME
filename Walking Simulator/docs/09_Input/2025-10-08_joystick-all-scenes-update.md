# 🎮 Joystick Support - All Scenes Update

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Type:** Feature Enhancement

---

## Summary

Extended joystick/gamepad support to **ALL** game scenes! Previously only working in one scene, now all three regional scenes (Pasar, Tambora, Papua) have full Xbox-like controller support with camera control, menu navigation, and resource-based settings.

---

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
User reported that joystick controls (especially run button, right analog stick for camera) were **not working** in:
- ❌ Tambora Root scene (Indonesia Tengah)
- ❌ Pasar scene (Indonesia Barat)  
- ❌ Papua Manual scene (Indonesia Timur)

Only the base Player.tscn had joystick support.

### Root Cause
Each regional scene uses a **different player controller script**:
- **Pasar** → `PlayerControllerFixed.gd` ✅ (already had joystick)
- **Tambora** → `PlayerControllerIntegrated_tambora.gd` ❌ (no joystick)
- **Papua** → `PlayerControllerIntegrated.gd` ❌ (no joystick)

The joystick camera code was only in `PlayerControllerFixed.gd`.

### Solution
1. Updated **all three** player controller scripts with joystick camera support
2. Added InputSettings resource support to all controllers
3. Added menu navigation inputs (A for select, analog/arrows for navigation)

---

## Features Added

### 1. Right Analog Stick Camera Control ✅
All three controllers now support right analog stick for camera movement:
- Works exactly like mouse look
- Configurable sensitivity
- Axis inversion options
- Frame-independent smooth movement

### 2. Menu Navigation Inputs ✅
Added full menu navigation support:
- **A Button** → Select/Enter
- **B Button** → Back/Cancel
- **Left Analog / D-Pad** → Navigate up/down/left/right
- Works alongside keyboard (Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)

### 3. Resource-Based Settings ✅
All controllers now use the InputSettings resource:
- Edit sensitivity in Inspector (no code!)
- One place for all settings
- Easy to create presets
- Perfect for "pelupa" users

## Controller Mapping

### In-Game Controls

| Button | Action | Keyboard |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **A** | Jump | Spacebar |
| **Y** | Interact with NPCs | E |
| **B** | Pick up items | F |
| **LB** | Sprint/Run | Shift |
| **Left Analog** | Player movement | WASD |
| **Right Analog** | Camera look | Mouse |
| **D-Pad** | Player movement | WASD |

### Menu Controls

| Button | Action | Keyboard |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **A** | Select/Confirm | Enter |
| **B** | Back/Cancel | Escape |
| **Left Analog** | Navigate | Arrow Keys |
| **D-Pad** | Navigate | Arrow Keys |

---

## Scene Compatibility

| Scene | Region | Player Controller | Status |
|-------|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Pasar Scene** | Indonesia Barat | `PlayerControllerFixed.gd` | ✅ Working |
| **Tambora Root** | Indonesia Tengah | `PlayerControllerIntegrated_tambora.gd` | ✅ Working |
| **Papua Manual** | Indonesia Timur | `PlayerControllerIntegrated.gd` | ✅ Working |

All scenes now have:
- ✅ Right analog camera control
- ✅ Button mappings (A, B, Y, LB)
- ✅ Resource-based settings
- ✅ Menu navigation
- ✅ Mouse + keyboard still work

---

## Technical Implementation

### Joystick Camera Code Pattern

All three controllers now use this pattern:

```gdscript
func handle_mouse_look():
    # Get mouse input
    var mouse_delta = last_mouse_delta
    last_mouse_delta = Vector2.ZERO
    
    # Get joystick input from right analog stick
    var joystick_input = Vector2.ZERO
    joystick_input.x = Input.get_action_strength("camera_right") - Input.get_action_strength("camera_left")
    joystick_input.y = Input.get_action_strength("camera_down") - Input.get_action_strength("camera_up")
    
    # Apply inversion if enabled
    if invert_joystick_x:
        joystick_input.x = -joystick_input.x
    if invert_joystick_y:
        joystick_input.y = -joystick_input.y
    
    # Scale joystick input
    joystick_input *= joystick_camera_sensitivity * get_process_delta_time()
    
    # Combine mouse and joystick input
    var combined_delta = mouse_delta + joystick_input
    
    # Apply rotation...
```

### InputSettings Resource Loading

All three controllers now have:

```gdscript
@export var input_settings: InputSettings

func _load_input_settings():
    if input_settings:
        # Load all settings from resource
        joystick_camera_sensitivity = input_settings.joystick_camera_sensitivity
        invert_joystick_x = input_settings.invert_joystick_x
        invert_joystick_y = input_settings.invert_joystick_y
        # ... plus movement speeds, jump force, etc.
```

## User Request Summary

**Original Request:**
> "Y is working but another key is not working like for run, right joystick. Can you check that it is implemented on tambora root scene and another pasar and papua_manual? Also can we use A key for enter, left analog and key 'arah' for selecting menu?"

**What We Did:**
1. ✅ Checked all three scenes (Tambora, Pasar, Papua)
2. ✅ Fixed right joystick camera in Tambora and Papua
3. ✅ Fixed run button (LB) in all scenes
4. ✅ Added A button for Enter/Select in menus
5. ✅ Added left analog and arrow keys for menu navigation
6. ✅ Made everything resource-based (no hardcoded values!)

## Configuration Guide

### Quick Setup (In Godot)

1. Open each scene's Player node:
   - `Scenes/IndonesiaBarat/PasarScene.tscn` → Player
   - `Scenes/IndonesiaTengah/Tambora/TamboraRoot.tscn` → Player
   - `Scenes/IndonesiaTimur/PapuaScene_Manual.tscn` → Player

2. In Inspector, find "Input Settings"

3. Assign: `Resources/Input/default_input_settings.tres`

4. Click on the resource to edit settings

5. Adjust "Joystick Camera Sensitivity" slider

6. Save!

### Sensitivity Recommendations

**Fast Camera:**
