# Continuous Webcam Operation with Dual Webcams

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ACTIVE**

---

## 🎯 Overview

With the **dual webcam setup**, the ML Ethnicity Detection server now operates **continuously** without pausing or releasing the camera. This eliminates the buggy pause/resume behavior and provides instant, reliable operation.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### ML Server (Port 8888, Camera 0)

**Startup:**
```
🎥 Initializing dedicated camera for ML server...
✅ Camera initialized - ML server ready!
🚀 ML-Enhanced UDP Server: 127.0.0.1:8888
🎥 Camera Status: Active and ready (dedicated hardware)
🔗 Waiting for client connections...
```

**During Operation:**
- ✅ **Camera always active** (never paused)
- ✅ **Frames continuously captured** from Camera 0
- ✅ **ML detection ready** at any time
- ✅ **No delay when client connects**

**When Client Connects:**
```
✅ Client registered: ('127.0.0.1', 58692) (Total: 1)
```
- Immediately starts sending frames (no initialization delay)
- ML detection active instantly

**When Client Disconnects:**
```
❌ Client unregistered: ('127.0.0.1', 58692) (Total: 0)
📹 No clients connected - camera stays active (dedicated hardware)
```
- Camera **keeps running**
- No pause, no release
- Ready for next client instantly

## 🎮 Godot Client (MLWebcamManager)

### Automatic ML Detection

The `MLWebcamManager.gd` has **built-in automatic detection**:

```gdscript
# Detection request timer - requests ML detection every 2 seconds
detection_request_timer = Timer.new()
detection_request_timer.wait_time = 2.0
detection_request_timer.timeout.connect(_request_detection)
detection_request_timer.one_shot = false
add_child(detection_request_timer)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic detection requests every 2 seconds
- ✅ Receives ML results via signal
- ✅ Handles multiple ML models
- ✅ Continuous webcam feed

### Immediate Connection

With dual webcams, connection is **instant**:

```gdscript
func setup_webcam_manager():
    # Create MLWebcamManager
    ml_webcam_manager = ml_webcam_script.new()
    add_child(ml_webcam_manager)
    
    # Connect signals
    ml_webcam_manager.frame_received.connect(_on_webcam_frame_received)
    ml_webcam_manager.detection_result_received.connect(_on_ml_detection_result)
    
    # ✅ DUAL WEBCAM: Connect immediately (no delays)
    ml_webcam_manager.connect_to_webcam_server()
```

**No More:**
- ❌ Delays for camera release
- ❌ Waiting for camera init
- ❌ RELEASE_CAMERA commands
- ❌ Complex pause/resume logic

## 🔧 Configuration

### Server Configuration

**File:** `Webcam Server/config.json`

```json
{
  "camera": {
    "camera_id": 0,
    "notes": "Camera ID 0 = First USB webcam (dedicated to ML/Ethnicity server)"
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 8888
  }
}
```

### Client Configuration

**File:** `EthnicityDetectionController.gd`

```gdscript
# Uses MLWebcamManager
var webcam_script = load("res://Scenes/EthnicityDetection/WebcamClient/MLWebcamManager.gd")
ml_webcam_manager = webcam_script.new()

# Connects immediately
ml_webcam_manager.connect_to_webcam_server()
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Starting the ML Server

```bash
cd "Webcam Server"
env\Scripts\activate.bat
python ml_webcam_server.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🎥 Initializing dedicated camera for ML server...
✅ Camera ready: 640x480 @ 15FPS (backend: DSHOW)
✅ Camera initialized - ML server ready!
🚀 ML-Enhanced UDP Server: 127.0.0.1:8888
📊 Settings: 640x480, 15FPS, Q40
🧠 ML Detection: Enabled
🎥 Camera Status: Active and ready (dedicated hardware)
🔗 Waiting for client connections...
```

### Opening Ethnicity Scene

1. **Start Godot** and open the project
2. **Open Ethnicity Detection scene**
3. **Watch Godot console:**
   ```
   === Setting up MLWebcamManager ===
   Creating MLWebcamManager instance...
   Connecting signals...
   ✅ frame_received signal connected
   ✅ detection_result_received signal connected
   🔄 Connecting to ML server (dedicated camera)...
   ✅ Connected to ML-enhanced server!
   ```

4. **Watch Server console:**
   ```
   ✅ Client registered: ('127.0.0.1', 58692) (Total: 1)
   📤 Frame 1: 13KB → 1 clients
   ```

5. **Webcam feed appears instantly!** ✅

## 🎭 Comparison with Topeng Server

### ML Server (Continuous)

```python
# Camera always active
def _broadcast_frames(self):
    while self.running:
        if len(self.clients) == 0:
            # Just skip sending, but keep camera running
            time.sleep(0.1)
            continue
        
        ret, frame = self.camera.read()  # ✅ Always reading
        # ... process and send frames
```

### Topeng Server (Pause when idle)

```python
# Camera pauses when no clients
def _broadcast_frames(self):
    while self.running:
        if len(self.clients) == 0:
            print("⏸️  No clients - camera paused")
            camera_paused = True
            time.sleep(0.5)
            continue  # ✅ Skips camera.read()
```

**Why Different?**

- **Topeng:** Works well with pause/resume (MediaPipe handles it cleanly)
- **Ethnicity:** Buggy with pause/resume (complex ML pipeline + face detection)
- **Solution:** Keep ML server always active with dedicated webcam

## ✅ Verification

### Test: Scene Switching

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   start_dual_webcam_servers.bat
   ```

2. **Open Ethnicity scene:**
   - ✅ Webcam appears instantly
   - ✅ ML detection starts automatically
   - ✅ No delays or black screens

3. **Exit to menu:**
   - Server: "Client unregistered, camera stays active"
   - ✅ No camera release

4. **Open Topeng scene:**
   - ✅ Different camera (Camera 1)
   - ✅ Works independently

5. **Back to Ethnicity:**
   - ✅ Instant connection
   - ✅ Webcam already running
   - ✅ Perfect!
